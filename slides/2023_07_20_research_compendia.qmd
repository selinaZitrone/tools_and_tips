## Steps of a scientific project

How to properly structure the project?

. . .

I want

- Reproduciblity 🔃 (for you and others)
- Reliablity 🏋 (will it work again?)
- Re-usablity ⚙ (don't re-invent the wheel)
- Visiblity 🔍 (let others see and use your work)


## How? Use a research compendium!

#### What is a research compendium

- Collection of all digital parts of a research project (data + code + text)

>The goal of a research compendium is to provide a **standard and easily recognizable** way for organizing the digital materials of a project to enable others to **inspect, reproduce, and extend** the research.

From the paper by Marwick et al. 2018

## Principles for building research compendia

- Stick with the conventions in your field
- Keep **data**, **methods** and **output** separate
	- Original data *read only*, output considered *disposable*
- Specify the computational environment
- Key components for sharing the compendium include
	- Licence
	- Version control
	- Metadata
	- Persistent identifier (e.g DOI)


## Examples of different complexities

They are R packages!

## R packages as research compendia

![](images/2023-07-20_research_compendia/Marwicketal2018.png){.r-stretch}

## R packages as research compendia

**Basic idea:** Hijack the R package development ecosystem to build research compendia

Different use cases, e.g.

- Publish code, data and analysis scripts alongside your paper
- Publish a dataset in a way that other people can work with it in R

## Some benefits of R packages

- Benefit from quality control mechanisms built around R packages
- Additional packages around this ecosystem to make your life easier
  - [`usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/): workflow package to automate tasks like project setup etc.
  - [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/): build a quick and easy website for your package
  - [`goodpractice`](https://github.com/mangothecat/goodpractice): gives you advice about good practices when building R packages
  - ... and many more
- Easy documentation
- Easy sharing of data
  
# Hands-on: Create a research compendium with the R package structure

> Find a detailed step-by-step guide on the website

## Summary and Conclusions

It's good to have standards and follow them

- R packages provide an Ecosystem for reproducible projects that we can hijack for our research compendia
- You can develop your compendium in different ways
	- Purpose is for people to install the package in the end
	- Purpose is just to use the quality checks from R Studio	
- `usethis` is a great workflow package that allows us to seamlessly follow this workshop

## Outlook

- Include large datasets with [piggyback](https://github.com/ropensci/piggyback)
- Automated tests with [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
- Unit tests to test your functions using [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/)
- Easily [connect Github repo to Zenodo](https://emilio-berti.github.io/idiv-git-introduction/21-github_zenodo/index.html) to get a DOI
- [holepunch package](https://karthik.github.io/holepunch/) to build a Docker image

. . .

The nice thing:

- Also these thins are easy to set up with `usethis` and friends
- They are also documented on the lecture series website

## Next lecture

Summer/Conference break in August and September!

. . .

Time for some feedback from you! Please fill out the questionnaire (5 mins)
