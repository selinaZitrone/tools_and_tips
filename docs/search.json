    "text": "Preparation\nBefore you start with the how-to, please check that you have the following things set up and running.\n\nR packages needed\nFirst, you need to install some packages. Some of them are essential for the core workflow, others are optional for some more advanced features that are described later in the how-to.\nYou can run the following code to install the packages that you still need:\n\npackages_essential &lt;- c(\"devtools\", \"usethis\", \"roxygen2\")\n# install the essential packages\ninstall.packages(setdiff(packages_essential, rownames(installed.packages())))\n\npackages_optional &lt;- c(\"goodpractice\", \"testthat\", \"piggyback\")\n# install the optional packages\ninstall.packages(setdiff(packages_optional, rownames(installed.packages())))\n\n\n\nSet up Git and Github\nYou only need this if you want to use version control with your research compendium, publish on Github and use Github actions to do automated testing of your package. Otherwise, you can skip this step and all the steps in the following guide that involve Git and Github.\nTo set everything up\n\nDownload and install Git on your machine\nCreate a GitHub Account\n\n\n\nPersonal Access token to use with R\nNow, you can add a personal access token (PAT) to your .Renviron file. This way, you can be identified to your Github account when you communicate with Github from R.\nTo set up you PAT call:\n\nusethis::create_github_token()\n\nThis will open Github in the browser (you might need to enter your password).\nOn top, enter a note on what you want to use the token for (e.g.¬†RStudio on my work computer). Then select an appropriate expiration date (90 days is fine in most cases - Github will send you an email when the token is about to expire so you can renew it).\nScroll over the scopes, select ‚Äòrepo‚Äô, ‚Äòuser‚Äô, ‚Äòworkflow‚Äô (usually this is already the default setting) and then click on ‚ÄòGenerate token‚Äô at the bottom.\nLeave the browser page open, copy the generated token to your clipboard and go back to RStudio. Add your PAT to the .Renviron file (don‚Äôt do this if you share your computer with other people or they can access your Github account) by calling:\n\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n\nFollow the prompt in the console and enter your PAT. Now you should be able to work with Github.\n\n\nInstall RTools (only on Windows)\nIf you are on a windows machine and you want to build R packages, you need to install RTools which contains the toolchains for building packages.\nYou can check if you already have Rtools installed with\n\n# Returns TRUE if Rtools is correctly installed\ndevtools::find_rtools()\n\nIf you need to install it, you can download Rtools from here. Chose the appropriate version for your version of R and follow the installation process."

    "text": "Step 3: Create a research compendium\n\nFill out the DESCRIPTION file\nThe DESCRIPTION file contains important metadata about your package and describes which other packages it needs to run correctly. If an R project contains a DESCRIPTION file, RStudio and devtools will consider it an R package.\nThere are a few conventions on how to fill out the fields of the DESCRIPTION file. Have a look at the R packages book to find out more about this.\nFor now, just look at how usethis already created a template for you. Fill out the dummy fields of the description file, e.g.\nPackage: temperatureBerlin\nType: Package\nTitle: Analyse Temperature Data From Berlin\nAuthors@R: \n    person(given = \"Selina\",\n           family = \"Baldauf\",\n           role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"),\n           email = \"selina.baldauf@fu-berlin.de\")\nDescription: Analysis of the temperature data collected in Berlin from our\n    research project xyz presented in paper abc.\nLicense: `use_mit_license()`, `use_gpl3_license()` or friends to\n    pick a license\nEncoding: UTF-8\nLazyData: true\nRoxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)\nRoxygenNote: 7.2.3\n\n\nAdd a license\nUse the usethis package to add a license, e.g.¬†for the GNU General Public License 3 (gpl-3) license you can use\nusethis::use_gpl3_license()\nThis adds a file LICENSE.md with your name (or the name(s) specified in the DESCRIPTION file) in it to the project and automatically updates the license field in DESCRIPTION.\n\n\nAdd data\nThe correct folder for datasets you want to make available in your research compendium is the data/ folder. However, the convention of R packages is that you can only store binary .RData files in there. All data that is not in .RData format (e.g.¬†csv files) can go into the data-raw/ folder and then they can be pre-processed and turned into .Rdata files from there.\n\nCreate a dataset with R\nWe first create a data-raw/ folder either manually or with\n\nusethis::use_data_raw(\"temperature\")\n\nThis will create a temperature.R file in data-raw/ which you can use to pre-process your raw data and then add it to the data/ folder as an .RData file.\nIn this R script, you can either create a fake data set using only R code, or you can read a csv file (or other data file), that you put into the data-raw/ folder before.\nAt the end of the script, you call the usethis::use_data() function to compress your data file and store it as .RData file in your package.\nSo, you can just put something like this in the temperature.R file and then run the script:\n\n# create a dummy dataset for temperature measurements\ntemperature &lt;- data.frame(id = 1:10, temp = rnorm(10, mean = 15, sd = 2))\n# or alternatively, if you have temperature data as csv in data-raw/\ntemperature &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"data-raw/temperature.csv\")\n\n# compress and store the data as .Rdata file\nusethis::use_data(temperature, overwrite = TRUE)\n\nNow have a look at the data/ folder in your project, where you will find a temperature.Rdata version of the data.\n\n\n\nAdd an analysis function\nAll R functions for your analysis go in the R/ folder. You can group related functions together in the same script but unrelated functions should go into separate scripts.\nHere, we create a simple function that prints the mean of a vector. We save this function in a new R script called printMean.R. To create this script in the correct location, you can conveniently run\n\nusethis::use_r(\"printMean\")\n\nThis will will create, save and open the script for you.\nNow add the following simple function to the script:\n\n# a simple printer function for the mean of a vector\nprintMean &lt;- function(x){\n  print(paste0(\"The mean value is \", mean(x, na.rm = T), \"!\"))\n}\n\nIf you forgot to do it, you can run devtools::check() now to see if everything is ok in your package. You will get a warning that you did not document your data and your function yet. This is what we will do in the next step.\n\n\nDocument function and data with roxygen2\nYou can document your functions and data using the package roxygen2. Roxygen2 will automatically generate .Rd documentation files in the man/ folder, update the NAMESPACE if you import or export functions and update the DESCRIPTION file if you include any functions from other packages.\nThe basic workflow is:\n\ninsert a roxygen skeleton for your function\n\n\neither use the RStudio GUI Code | Insert Roxygen Skeleton or the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + Shift + R (on Windows)\n\n\ncall devtools::document() or use Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + D to generate the documentation in the man/ folder and update the NAMESPACE\n\nTo create a documentation for our simple printMean function, navigate to the respective R script, click inside the function and add a roxygen skeleton.\nFill out the skeleton by adding all the information about the function using the roxygen tags. E.g. your roxygen description could look like the following:\n\n#' @title Print mean values in a sentence\n#' @description This function calculates the mean of its input and prints it \n#'    into a sentence. The function is called in the analysis.Rmd file\n#' @export\n#' @param x A vector of numeric values of which to calculate the mean\n#' \n#' @return The output of \\code{\\link{print}} after calculating the \n#'    \\code{\\link{mean}} and pasting it into a sentence\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' printMean(c(1,2,3))\n#'\n\nTo document datasets in your compendium create a new R script with the same name as your dataset in the R/ directory (in our case temperature.R) (remember usethis::use_r(\"temperature\")?) and describe your data set before specifying the name of your dataset as a string. As a bare minimum this could look like the following:\n\n#' @title Temperature data from place X\n#' @description Temperature measurements (2m height) measured on March 21st, \n#'     2009 at place x\n#' @format A \\code{data.frame} with 2 columns, which are:\n#' \\describe{\n#' \\item{id}{id of the sensor}\n#' \\item{temp}{temperature in ¬∞C}\n#'}\n\"temperature\"\n\nUnfortunately, for data sets you can‚Äôt automatically insert a preset roxygen skeleton.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you are too lazy to document your dataset by hand, you can use the sinew package which is very convenient with package documentation using roxygen2. Install the package with\n\n# install.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github('yonicd/sinew')\n\nand then run\n\nsinew::makeOxygen(obj = temperature)\n\nThis will print you a perfect, pre-made skeleton for the data to the console, and you can just copy paste it to your temperature.R file and then fill out the placeholders.\n\n\nIf you now run devtools::document() or rebuild your package, you will find an automatically generated read-only file printMean.Rd and temperature.Rd in the man/ folder of your research compendium. If you now call ?printMean or ?dummyTempData (after installing and restarting) you open the help file just like with any other R function you know.\nPlease also have a look at the conventions and guidelines on roxygen2-documentation and the quick reference of the most common tags.\n\n\nAdd an analysis script\nWe will now add an analysis script in the form of a Quarto document (could also be an R Script instead). Here we write some analysis using the data and functions that we just defined.\nAdd an /analysis folder with an quarto document report.qmd to your compendium. This can for example look like this:\n---\ntitle: \"Temperature Analyis\"\nauthor: \"Selina Baldauf\"\ndate: \"17 April, 2025\"\n---\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\ndevtools::load_all(\".\")\n```\n\n# This is the temperature analysis\n\n```{r}\nprintMean(dummyTempData$temp)\n```\nWith the devtools::load_all(\".\") command, we tell the document to first load all functions included in the package before running the code chunks."

    "text": "Extras\n\nHow to include large external data sets with piggyback\nIf you use an R package as a research compendium, you might also want to share large datasets along with it. The problem is, that you cannot manage those large files anymore by tracking them with git and commiting directly to GitHub. However, GitHub allows you to attach up to 2 GB of files to each release of your project. The piggyback package takes advantage of this and allows you to create GitHub releases, upload and download large datasets associated with your compendium.\nFirst, we simulate a large datafile by creating a dataset in our data-raw folder (if you have really large file you would not save them as .txt but rather compress them first).\nlargeDataSet &lt;- data.frame(id = 1:1e6, temp = rnorm(1e6,15,2))\nwrite.table(largeDataSet, \"data-raw/largeDataSet.txt\")\nTo use the piggyback package, you first need to install it on your machine with install.packages(\"piggyback\"). To upload our dataset, we first need to create a new release on GitHub. The first release has to be created on the GitHub website, by clicking on Create a new release, giving it a Tag (e.g.¬†v0.0.1) and a title. You will see that the release contains your source code as zip and as a tarball (.tar.gz).\nWith piggyback you can always list your existing releases by running\n\npiggyback::pb_list()\n\nNow that you created your first release, you can create new releases directly from R with:\n\npiggyback:pb_new_release(\"v0.0.2\")\n\nTo track your dataset (which means that every time the dataset changes you can create a new release), call\n\npiggyback::pb_track(\"data-raw/largeDataSet.txt\")\n\nTo piggyback your dataset to your package, you now simply have to run\n\npiggyback::pb_upload(\"data-raw/largeDataSet.txt\")\n\nNow you can find it attached to your latest release.\nIf you want to use the large dataset in your package for the analysis or to generate the report, you can write a function to download the data using piggyback::pb_download. Just create a new file loadData.R in your R/ directory and add the following function.\n\nloadData &lt;- function(){\n  piggyback::pb_download(repo = \"selinaZitrone/temperture\")\n}\n\nWhen this function is called, it will automatically download all the assets attached to the latest release of the repository and put them in data-raw/. Now the data can be accessed by all the package functions. Have a look at ?piggyback::pb_download to see which parameters you can specify. You don‚Äôt have to download all the assets and you can also chose which version of the release should be used for the download.\nYou can also create new releases directly from piggyback and you can track large datasets by creating new releases if the datasets change. This will not be covered here, but if you are interested have a look at the piggyback documentation.\n\n\nUnit testing\nWith unit testing, you can test the individual functions in your package to make them more reliable. If you want to read about unit testing, you can check out the testing chapter in the Rpkg book.\nFirst, create the infrastructure needed by the thestthat package.\n\nusethis::use_testthat()\n\nThis creates a tests/ folder which contains a testthat/ folder and an R script testthat.R. You do not need to change anything in the testthat.R script. It is called e.g.¬†by rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck() to run all the tests you created in your package. The testthat/ folder is the place to store the R scripts with your actual tests. Also, the testthat package is automatically added to the Suggests field in DESCRIPTION.\nNow you can add a test script that tests your simple printer function. To create a test script for a specific function, open the R-script with the function and then initialize a basic test file for the script by calling\n\nusethis::use_test()\n\nThe testfile can be found in /tests/testthat. Testfiles have to be named test-xyz.R in order to be found (usethis::use_test() does the naming for you - so you don‚Äôt have to worry about it).\nWe can write a very simple test function for our printMean function that checks if it works correctly\n\ntest_that(\"printer function works\", {\n  expect_equal(printMean(c(1,2,3)), \"The mean value is 2!\")\n})\n\nIf you run the test and you don‚Äôt get any errors in the console, then it means that your test was successful. If not you will get a helpful error message telling you what went wrong.\nIf you want to run all the tests from your package at once to see if they pass your can run\n\ndevtools::test()\n\n\n\nImplement a continuous integration workflow with GitHub Actions\nGitHub actions allows you to run code on GitHub servers, everytime you push something there. This can e.g.¬†be used to run the R CMD CHECK that checks your package. This way you can automatically make sure that your package is build without errors. Otherwise you will get notified by Github.\nBefore you implement this, commit all the recent changes and push them to Github.\nThen create the basic file structure needed to set up a workflow by calling\nusethis::use_github_actions()\nThis creates a .github folder, in which you find a .gitignore file and a workflows/ folder. In this folder you can store all your GitHub actions in .yaml file format. usethis automatically added a first GitHub action called R-CMD-check.yaml. This action is triggered on every push or pull request on the master/main branch and checks your package to make sure that new code does not break the package.\nIf you want to add other actions that already are available (e.g.¬†from the GitHub repository r-lib/actions) you can do the following:\n\nusethis::use_github_action(\"render-readme.yaml\")\n\nThis adds the respective yaml-file to .github/workflows. Of course you can also write your own actions and simply add them to the workflows/ folder.\n\n\nAdd an RStudio server with holepunch\nThere is a nice intro for holepunch: Getting started with holepunch.

By default, the spell check will be for American English. However, you can change the langauage by adding a Language field to your DESCRIPTION file.\nIf you want to write a new function and generate the corresponding R script in the R/ directory, you can conveniently call usethis::use_r(\"functionName\"). This will create a file functionName.R ind the R/ directory and open it for you.\nUse the goodpractice package to further test your package for parts which can be improved. Running goodpractice::gp(){R} will tell you where your comment lines are too long, where you should consider renaming variables, if something is wrong with your NAMESPACE, ‚Ä¶"
